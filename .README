UNDERSTANDING WEBSOCKETS 
1. Polling (wastage or overkill) communication of 2 clients through a server will be a overkill because it the client will ask the server weather the server has a message for him or not and what the message is the communication between these clients is a overkill or wastage of http requests

2.  WEBSOCKETS (Solution) clients sends a connection request to the server it is nothing but a simple server request but it tells the server to maintain the connection with the use of upgrade header which upgrades the HTTPS request -> WEBSOCKETS request which now makes the communication Bi-directional
